This app packages InfluxDB v2.0

InfluxDB empowers developers to build IoT, analytics and monitoring software. It is purpose-built to handle the massive volumes and countless sources of time-stamped data produced by sensors, applications and infrastructure.

## Purpose

InfluxDB empowers developers to build IoT, analytics and monitoring software. It is purpose-built to handle the massive volumes and countless sources of time-stamped data produced by sensors, applications and infrastructure.

## Features

*InfluxDB has everything you need from a time series platform in a single binary  a multi-tenanted time series database, UI and dashboarding tools, background processing and monitoring agent. All this makes deployment and setup a breeze and easier to secure.
*Flux is a fourth-generation programming language designed for data scripting, ETL, monitoring and alerting. As a functional language, you can structure queries and separate common logic into functions and libraries that are easily shared and help speed development. Flux can also be used to enrich your time series data with other SQL data stores (Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and SAP Hana) along with cloud-based data stores (Google Bigtable, Amazon Athena, and Snowflake). Enriching time series data provides context that can provide further insights into your data.
*Everything in InfluxDB  ingest, query, storage and visualization  is now accessible in a unified API. This enables faster time to awesome for developers because everything in the platform can now be programmatically accessed and controlled. This is combined with a powerful set of client libraries across 10 languages (like Go, Java, PHP and Python) and a set of InfluxDB command line tools helps developers develop in a way that is most familiar to them.
*InfluxDB features a best-in-class UI that includes a Data Explorer, dashboarding tools, and a script editor. Use the Data Explorer to quickly browse through the metric and event data you collected and apply common transformations. The Dashboarding tool comes with a handy list of visualizations that help you to see insights from your data faster. And finally, use the script editor to quickly learn Flux with easily accessible examples, auto-completion and real-time syntax checking.
*InfluxDB Templates  a new set of tools that includes a packager and a set of pre-made monitoring solutions  allow you to share your monitoring expertise with coworkers and other community members around the world. The InfluxDB Templates gallery features available templates covering some of the most popular tools, applications, and protocols. These templates can also be checked in as code, fitting in with your continuous integration and deployment pipelines to make deploying (and more importantly rolling back) changes painless.
